# What Does “Well Written Python Code” Mean?

 **In most cases there are several different ways to organise your code.** Criteria that defines the correct way(s) to organise your code blocks are as follows:

  1. your code **outputs correct results** for any valid combination of user inputs (if there are any user inputs);
  2. there are **no repetitions in your code** (repetitions make the code long to write, long to read and impossible to maintain). This includes structural repetitions;
  3. your code is **as simple as possible so that other people can understand your code easily.** Ideally, other people should be able to modify it if needed. To do this safely, there should be some sample code, called regression tests, that they would run to make sure they had not introduced a bug by accident while doing the change;
  4. your code outputs **intelligible error message(s)** if the user input(s) are not valid;
  5. your code **runs reasonably quickly and consumes reasonable amount of computer memory** (this criteria is almost always satisfied for the beginner’s code).



In addition to this, there are style guides. The official Python style guide is [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Many code editors allow you to format your code to comply with most of the rules of the style guides.   
Identifying repetitions and making sure the results are correct is much less automatable a task, this is why these requirements are on top of the list.

What style(s) do you like best?
