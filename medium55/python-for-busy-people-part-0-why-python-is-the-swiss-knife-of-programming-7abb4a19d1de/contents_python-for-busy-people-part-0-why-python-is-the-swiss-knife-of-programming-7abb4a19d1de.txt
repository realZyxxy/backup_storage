# Python Pieces For Busy People 0/5: Why Python Is The Swiss Knife Of Programming

Python is versatile and easy to learn, but can be slow and not suitable for some purposes.

## What’s Great About Python

  * It’s very quick to learn, and it’s possible to write the code quickly;
  * The code is very compact, there is no clutter;
  * It’s extremely popular, widely used and and well integrated: Excel, images, PDFs, databases, financial data fetching, data science, AI in general and ChatGPT in particular, and more are supported through various packages.



## What’s Not Great About Python

  * It’s more resource-intense than other programming languages:   
Python is slower, its multithread support is limiter, and it consumes more memory;
  * Python is not great for mobile apps development, and is not suitable for client-side web development (although Anaconda’s <https://pyscript.com/> might fix the latter problem for data visualisation).
